## Cryptocurrency Payment Withdrawal Method for Dokan by CryptoPay

### What does this plugin do?

CryptoPay is essentially a cryptocurrency payment gateway, but with its modular structure, it can be integrated into many processes. With our Dokan Withdrawal integration, you will be able to accept crypto payments with CryptoPay and also pay your vendors in crypto.

### How does it work?

As you can see in the pictures, all you need to do is activate CryptoPay in the withdrawal settings, then as you can see in picture two, vendors can specify the blockchain network and currency they want to receive payments from their dashboards, then when they create a withdrawal request, all you need to do is pay with CryptoPay as in picture 3.
